          <p>appeared in late 2004 and the third generation model (W176) was launched in 2012. The fourth generation model (W177), which was launched in 2018, will mark the first time the A-Class is offered in the United States and Canada.[1] This fourth generation A-Class will also be the first to be offered both as a hatchback (W177) and sedan (V177).[2]

Originally produced only as a five-door hatchback in 1997, the second generation W169 introduced a three-door hatchback. In the markets where the A-Class is or has been sold, it has represented the entry level model for Mercedes-Benz. Having grown by 68 cm (27 in) since the original model, the 2012 third generation A-class was longer than the first-generation B-class. And although sometimes referred to by fans as the 'Baby Benz', Mercedes themselves actually use that moniker for the 1982 Mercedes 190 (W201), their first compact executive car model.[3]</p>
